        "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This file documents the `FishPythonScript.py` script to explain the algorithms and code used to process fish data. The author of the script is Tonja Dwyer (tonjadwyer@gmail.com), though some comments in the script were edited/added by me. The script is stored in the PythonCaller transformer within the FME Workbench named 'wb4 - fish id finder', which assigns fish individual IDs to observations - either new IDs or existing ones from the database. However, the code in this document is fully runnable on its own, as long as the instructions in section 2 are followed. Notice that in the PythonCaller version of the script, the modules `fme` and `fmeobjects` are imported for the transformer to work. Though, since this document is not connected to FME, importing these modules is not necessary to run the code in this document. Lastly, if you are accessing the GitHub copy of this file, click the \"Open in Colab\" link at the top of this document. This will take you to the interactive python notebook environment where you can run the code!"

Same thing happenes with variable `v`, and thus it is assigned the value `2`. Then, the `if` statement evaluates to `TRUE` and thus makes `v` the parent of `1`.

Therefore, the parent of `2` is now `5`, and the group that `2` and `1` were initially in is joined with the group that `5` is in. However, note that until the `find` method is called for `1` (i.e., `example_object.find(1)`), its parent still remains as `2` in the `example_object.parent` dictionary.

The script does this by storing all distinct observation numbers in a set, and calling the `find` method for each number in this set. Remember, the `find` method flattens the structure.
